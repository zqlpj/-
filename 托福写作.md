# 综合写作听力内容

- 篇章结构

  200~ 250w 

  1 intro + 3 bodies

- 中间段技巧 

1. Introduction

   开头段不用去听，听不听的懂都不影响之后的理解

   开头段需要了解Speaker是否会有特殊身份在里面，比如不是教授

2. Errors

   - 第一句话会先提到阅读观点

   - 然后是反驳矛盾点

   - 再然后是反驳细节

   重要的内容会说两遍 一旦涉及对比，两边都会有相同信息

3. Hacker

   -  需要掌握学科词汇

4. Topic

   - 细节对称

     两边空间有限

     是否作出内容重要性判断

     能不能反映人们的兴趣所在
